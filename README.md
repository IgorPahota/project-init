# ProjectInit v.0.9

This is a small script that will download Airbnb base config for ESLint, create .gitignore and .eslintrc.js to your project folder. Optionally it can download template for Jasmine tester.

It can be called by entering this command in the root of your project:

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilya-mikhaylov/project-init/master/init.sh)
```

Current version is tested on Ubuntu 19.10. Feel free to contact and maintain this small project.
